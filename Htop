Once atop is running, press the following shortcut keys to sort processes:

a – sort in order of most active resource.
c – revert to sorting by cpu consumption (default).
d – sort in order of disk activity.
m – sort in order of memory usage
n – sort in order of network activity
Guide to reading atop reports/logs
By default after install the atop daemon writes snapshots to a compressed log file (eg. /var/log/atop/atop_20140813). These log files can be read using:

atop -r /full/path/to/atop/log/file
Once you open a log file (eg. atop -r /var/log/atop/atop_20140813) then use t to go forward in 10 minute intervals and T to go back. You can analyse specific times by pressing b then entering the time. The above shortcut keys also work in this mode… a, c, d, m,n.

You can use shortcuts with atopsar. For example, using the flag “-c 30 5” with atopsar will generate a report for current CPU utilization for 5 minutes (ten times with intervals of 30 seconds):

atopsar -c 30 5
Using the flag -A with return all available reports.

atopsar -A
But you can limit this to a specific time window using beginning “-b” and end “-e” flags:

atopsar -A -b 11:00 -e 11:15
